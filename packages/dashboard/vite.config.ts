    // most of that is stabilising effect dependencies, which the compiler does without being asked.
    //
    // Enabled only after the linter agreed. `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7`'s recommended set carries
    // the compiler's own diagnostics (`refs`, `purity`, `immutability`, `globals`,
    // `set-state-in-render`, `static-components` among its 16 rules), it has been on in
    // `eslint.config.mjs` all along, and it reports no errors. It caught a `useRef` written during
    // render while #828 was being written, which is the evidence that it bites rather than
    // decorates.
    //
    // All 16 are on. `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` was the last, off over 15 violations until
    // #845 cleared them, so a clean lint here now says every diagnostic in the set passes. Neither
    // of the two rules that actually gate compilation is among them.
