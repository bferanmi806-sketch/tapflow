/**
 * The signed-in user, read once for the layout, the sidebar and settings alike — each used to fetch
 * `/auth/me` on its own (#845).
 *
 * **No redirect here.** `DashboardLayout` renders `<Navigate to="/login">` when `user` is null, which
 * made the `navigate` this hook used to call a duplicate.
 *
 * **Loading until the first answer, and never again after it.** The layout renders nothing while
 * loading, and this query refetches on window focus. Keyed on `isSuccess`, one failed refetch — a
 * Wi-Fi blip, a relay restart — unmounted the whole dashboard, a streaming QA session with it. Keyed
 * on having an answer, a failed refetch keeps the last user; a first load that fails stays blank, as
 * it always did.
