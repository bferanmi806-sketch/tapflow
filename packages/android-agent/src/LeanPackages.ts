/**
 * Lean mode on Android: bundled Google apps nobody testing an app needs, kept disabled while Lean
 * mode is on and put back when it is turned off.
 *
 * **Why disabled, and why it has to last across boots.** The emulator has no memory balloon on
 * macOS, so a page the guest touched stays the host's until the process exits. Measured on API 34
 * (2026-09-25): these apps start at boot and account for about 350 MB of the ~2 GB the guest
 * touches, and restricting them to the background changed nothing — they start anyway, and the
 * guest fills the space with page cache. Disabling them works, but only if they are disabled
 * *before* the boot: the boot that disables them has already paid. So unlike iOS, where the
 * override is written before each boot and removed at shutdown, this state lives in the AVD for as
 * long as Lean mode is on.
 *
 * **Chosen for what an app under test can still do.** Measured by resolving intents before and
 * after: speech recognition is served by `com.google.android.tts` and `com.google.android.as`, not
 * the Google app, so voice input keeps working. The Google app is the only handler of
 * `ACTION_WEB_SEARCH` and holds the assistant role, and those two go while it is off (the role
 * returns when it is re-enabled). Photos was measured and left out: it is the only handler of
 * `ACTION_VIEW image/*`, so an app's "open photo" would fail. Messages, Gmail and Maps are left
 * out for the same reason — SMS, `mailto:` and `geo:` intents.
