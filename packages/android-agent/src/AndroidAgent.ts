// an already-running emulator and relaunches it with `-wipe-data`.
// `network-control` claims what the other two claim: this agent has the code. Whether airplane mode
// actually works on a given image is per device, and `network:state.available` carries that — the
// split the protocol documents. Added last, after the handler and the boot-time reset, because the

/**
 * A normalised point on the **displayed** screen, mapped to the display's **natural** space.
 *
 * The emulator's gRPC `sendTouch` takes pixels in the natural orientation — measured, not assumed:
 * sending x=2100 to a Pixel 9 Pro Fold produced `ABS_MT_POSITION_X = 33145` against a 32767 axis
 * maximum, and `2100 × 32767 / 33145 = 2076`, the natural width, while the live display was 2152
 * wide. The viewer normalises against what Android is drawing. Without this map the axes are
 * swapped, which is a tap landing 90° from the finger.
 *
 * **Keyed on Android's display rotation, not the emulator's frame rotation.** The gRPC frame
 * carries a rotation field and it is the device's physical orientation: folded, it still reports
 * `REVERSE_LANDSCAPE` while Android has rotated the screen back to 0. Keying on it was right
 * unfolded and wrong folded.
 *
 * Rotation 0 is the identity, which is why an ordinary phone never needed this.
 */
/**
 * The emulator's per-frame rotation, in degrees clockwise.
 *
 * This is the **skin's** orientation — the proto says it is "derived from the sensor state of the
 * emulator" — and the capture follows it rather than the display. Measured on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold:
 * natural 2076x2152 arrived as 2152x2076 unfolded and natural 1080x2424 arrived as 2424x1080
 * folded, the same turn in both postures, while Android's own rotation went from 270 to 0.
 *
 * **Read per frame, not assumed.** A first version hard-coded 270 from this AVD, which is a value
 * that AVD's startup orientation produced — a device created in portrait would have made it wrong,
 * silently, on a machine nobody was testing on.

/** How often a live session re-reads the display while it is being watched.

 *  few hundred milliseconds after the panel changes, and nothing in `dumpsys` marks the gap: sampled
 *  150ms into an unfold, `init`, `cur`, `app` and `mRotation` are all consistent with each other and
 *  all describe the posture being left. So "has it settled?" is not a question the device answers —
 *  it is only answerable in hindsight, by the value changing.
 *
 *  Polling turns that from a race into a delay. A reading taken too early is corrected on the next
 *  pass instead of persisting, which is what made the error look like it accumulated: every other
 *  fold landed inside the gap and stayed wrong until the one after it happened to land outside.
 *
 *  It also covers the case folding merely exposed. `mRotation` changes without any fold — the
 *  toolbar's rotate button, an app asking for a different orientation — and nothing here was
 *  watching for that either. */

 *  window, agree with each other, and describe the posture the device is leaving. Measured across
 *  seven folds: six correct and one — an unfold — reading `rot 0` where it should have read 270,
 *  which is a visible quarter turn.
 *
 *  So the run has to be longer than the lag: three readings 300ms apart span 600ms, past the point
 *  where both values had caught up in every sample taken. The ceiling is generous because the cost
 *  of waiting is a spinner the viewer is already showing, while the cost of being early is a

  /**
   * The one live device, or a refusal — **the resolver every session-less entry point shares.**
   *
   * `IOSAgent.soleOf` has done this since #607 and says why: *"Refusing beats guessing: this interface
   * has no way to say which device is meant, and picking one silently is the whole defect being fixed
   * here."* Same defect, same interface, and this class never got it — eleven entry points each took
   * `deviceStates.values().next().value`, the entry the relay happened to register first. For a read
   * that answers about the wrong device; for `setNetworkOffline` it takes a device off the network
   * while somebody else is testing on it (#617).
   *
   * **Liveness is `adb` reporting the emulator attached — not tapflow having launched it.**
   * `IOSAgent.soleDeviceState`'s comment says this map is "only populated on launch" and that is
   * **wrong**: `AdbWrapper.listDevices` syncs it from `adb devices` on every call, taking every
   * `emulator-*` in state `device` whoever started it, and dropping the ones that went away. The
   * claim was inherited from that comment and checked afterwards; it is recorded here so the next
   * reader does not inherit it again.
   *
   * So a developer with their own emulator open, plus one a tester booted, is two live devices — and
   * refusing there would be the feature removed by its own fix. `ownedDevices` is what separates
   * them, and it is why that set exists rather than the serial map being enough on its own. **iOS
   * narrows the same way for the same desk** (`soleLiveDeviceState`), after a version that did not.
   *
   * **What ownership does not cover**: an emulator tapflow launched and someone else killed keeps
   * its serial *and* its ownership until the next `listDevices()` syncs the map (`AdbWrapper` calls
   * that removal "stale serials"). A ghost can still make a live device ambiguous for that window.
   * Refusing is the safe direction there, and the window closes on the next device listing.
   *
   * **Absence is not an error here**, because the touch entry points have always no-opped without a
   * device and making them throw would change more than the ambiguity this fixes. `soleLive` is the
   * variant that demands one.
   *
   * **Ambiguity is an error even for input, and there this class diverges from iOS on purpose.**
   * `IOSAgent.liveDeviceState` returns `undefined` when it cannot choose, so a tap on a
   * two-simulator desk silently does nothing. Silence is the failure mode this repo keeps removing:
   * a tester taps, nothing moves, and no channel says why. `touchStart` returns `void` so a throw is
   * the only signal available to it, and `touchMove`/`touchEnd` reject.
